A browser extension that allows you to enjoy unlimited medium articles with just a click !


## Install

- Or clone [the project repo](https://github.com/issammani/unlimited-medium) and install.

## Usage
The extension is by default disabled until the currently active tab is a medium tab. In which case, the pageAction turns green and clicking the icon will result in clearing the browsing data and refreshing the page. 

Ta-da ðŸŽ‰ you just got 3 new articles !

So basically: 
- Read
- Reach the monthly limit
- Click the icon
- Repeat
