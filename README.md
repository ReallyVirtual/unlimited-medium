![Logo](https://github.com/issammani/unlimited-medium/blob/master/assets/unlimited-medium-logo.png?raw=true)

A browser extension that allows you to enjoy unlimited medium articles with just a click !


## Install
- This extension uses the WebExtension API, so technically it should work in any browser with support for the API.

- [Chrome Web Store]()
- [Firefox Addon Store]()
- Or clone [the project repo]() and install.

## Usage
The extension is by default disabled until the currently active tab is a medium tab. In which case, the pageAction turns green and clicking the icon will result in clearing the browsing data and refreshing the page. 

Ta-da ðŸŽ‰ you just got 3 new articles !

So basically: 
- Read
- Reach the monthly limit
- Click the icon
- Repeat
